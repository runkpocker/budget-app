Build: 2025-10-29_170916

Files
- appsscript.json
- server.gs
- index.html
- client.html
- styles.html

Highlights
- No auto-month on load; user must click **Set Month**.
- Fetch shows centered modal with hopping 🐰 and the message:
  "Hang on to your Bunny Hairs, Daddy is getting the info..."
- Button animates as **Good Girrrrrl ✨** during fetch, then resets.
- Uses theme variables for easy rebrand later.
